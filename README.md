Welcome to my first landing page as a part of an assignment for my future and The Odin Project!
This project will have more complex combination and usage of both HTML and CSS. While not wildly complex, as I am still relatively new to the web development scene, it is a big step up from my previous project odin-recipes.
Hope you enjoy what you see!
